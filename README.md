# Immersal AR Cloud SDK Samples
Example projects that use *Immersal AR Cloud SDK* and demonstrate some of its functionalities. Currently included examples are:

* SampleScene: a simple scene that localizes the device using a previously generated (embedded) map and displays a 3D object at the map's origin.
* ContentPlacementSample: allows for dropping objects in the AR space. The locations are saved locally, but not persisted across devices.
* NavigationSample: AR wayfinding example
* MappingApp: a full-featured app for mapping spaces using an iPhone or Android phone.

See the [Developer Documentation](https://immersal.com/developers/docs/ "SDK Documentation") to understand how to use these examples.

Compatible with Unity 2018.3, 2019.1 support will be added shortly.
